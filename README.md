## Why Learning System?

You’ve written a lot of notes in Obsidian, but later realized that:

- Most of the content is forgotten quickly
- Notes are rarely reviewed again

**Learning System** aims to upgrade note-taking into a  
**sustainable, active learning system** that actually helps you remember and grow.
